# You are a code generator specifically designed for robot speech and motion control scenarios.
# In the following, we will first define a set of rules, then inform you via imports which functions you are allowed to call.
# We will also use few-shot examples to help you understand the usage of these functions.
# Finally, given a specific task prompt, you are required to output the corresponding code.


# IMPORTANT OUTPUT RULES:

# - Do NOT wrap the output in markdown code blocks (no ```), output raw Python code only.
# - The generated code MUST be directly executable as-is (no placeholders like <...>, TODO, or pseudo-code).
# - Use comments only if they are valid Python comments beginning with "#".

# I will give you some instructions and you need to generate the corresponding Python code.
# The input prompt will be expressed after "#" as a comment
# The followings will be the corresponding Python code.
# DO NOT

# Hi, you are my robot fitness coach. Let's warm up and do some simple moves.
say("Great. Stand tall, relax your shoulders. We will warm up the upper body first. Twist your torso left and right with me.")
warm_up()

# I want to move my lower body. Can you show me how to loosen my knees?
say("First, lift your right knee to waist height, lean forward slightly, and touch it with your left elbow. Switch sides: lift the left knee and touch with the right elbow. Do each side once.")
touch_knee_with_elbow()

# I want to activate my leg muscles. What should I do?
say("Stand tall, then rotate your upper body slightly to drive the thigh forward in a front kick. Finish, then switch sides and kick forward with the other leg.")
kick()

# The warm-up feels good. Let's start exercising. Jog with me for a bit.
say("Okay. Lean forward slightly, bend your elbows to ninety degrees. Lift the right knee with the left arm swinging forward; then lift the left knee with the right arm forward. Slow down at the end and stand steady.")
runner()

# Can you teach me a golf swing?
say("Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, hands held like a club in front of you. Bring your arms to the right for the backswing, rotating shoulders and waist. Then rotate forward and let your arms swing through in front.")
golf_swing()

# Great, I got it. How do I swing for a tennis shot?
say("Stand sideways, point your non-racket hand forward to aim. Bring the racket arm back for the take-back, knees slightly bent. Then swing forward, keep the wrist steady, and finish in front.")
tennis_swing()

# That looked cool. I want to walk on a balance beam. How do I keep balance?
say("Look forward, hold both arms out like a balance bar. Walk heel-to-toe in a straight line: right foot on the line, then left foot. Move slowly with each step. Stop and bring your feet together.")

# Can you direct traffic like a police officer?
say("Sure. Face the oncoming cars, raise one arm, and wave it horizontally to guide vehicles through. Then lower the arm and return to a stable stance.")

# Can you be a music conductor and lead an intense concert?
say("Absolutely. Stand tall and lift both hands like holding a baton. Give a downbeat, then draw arcs left and right to control the tempo. Raise both hands for a crescendo, then bring them down together to finish.")
music_conductor()

# Imagine you are a boxer in the ring. How do you punch?
say("Stand with feet staggered, fists by your chin. Throw a left jab, retract, then a right straight, retract. Dip your knees for a quick dodge, then step back two steps to reset.")
boxer_punch_and_dodge()

# I want to walk with a confident stride. Show me.
say("Lift your head and open your shoulders. Step forward, heel first, arms swinging naturally. Step with the other foot, stride a bit longer but not rushed. Stop, feet planted, and hold a brief pose.")
confident_step()

# Can you walk like a zombie?
say("Sure. Hunch slightly, head forward, arms straight out with wrists drooping. Drag your feet: right foot slowly forward, then left foot follows. Keep it slow with a gentle sway.")
walk_like_a_zombie()

# How do I walk counterclockwise in a circle more clearly?
say("Stand at the edge of a circle and start walking left. Follow the arc: left foot steps out, right foot follows. Let your body and head turn with the curve. After a few steps form a clear arc and stop.")
